# Forest Laps

This app allows you to set an arbitrary GPS location as your start/end point and will
track your timing and speed (soon) after you exit and return to this point.

I created this app for tracking my single track riding in the back yard, so it might be useful
for you too.

### Current status: Prototype

## Privacy Policy

I don't store or send any of the GPS data anywhere.  It currently, can't even store the lap
timing info but that option will be coming later.
